# A short homework task

Instructions:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

2. On the `homework.Rmd` file, fill in your responses to the questions using an editor or IDE such as RStudio. Where R code is required, use R code chunks: see [this link](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html). For larger functions, you can move your code to another script. Partial credit may be given where incomplete solutions are provided. Attempt as many questions as you can.

3. 'Knit' the your final `.Rmd` document to produce an `.html` file. Push this to your fork then and send us the link to this file.


Notes:

- Show your reasoning where required - your responses must be self-contained but we may discuss them with you further.
- Use whichever packages you wish, including plotting packages.
- Use standard LaTeX commands for questions where equations are needed. To reduce the burden of typesetting all your working, you may explain the intermediate steps you took in words and give the final result in LaTeX.
